Then, I load all of this information into a database. I have example queries for each of the tables loaded into the DB, showing what sorts of questions can be asked about the data.\n",

Projects are extremely hard, no structure to the course and lack of examples in class. TA's are more helpful at explaining concepts then the teacher. No piazza even tho class is online.  ...  2020-11-20\n",
              "6                                             Misurda is easily the worst computer science professor in the department. Lectures are monotonous, no online discussion board for help, and seems to not care about feedback regarding his course. I have a high B in this course and have had to do all studying outside of the lecture. Avoid all of his classes if possible  ...  2020-11-12\n",
              "7                           The class wasn't all that difficult and it is my fault for slacking off towards the end. But he was easily the worst CS professor I have ever had. I'm not sure if it was just me but the way he taught the class and interacted with students made me feel very unmotivated to participate. I would avoid taking a class with him at all costs.  ...  2020-11-06\n",

He is a kind of professor who hope students to go to his office hour. If you go to, he love talking with you and answer clearly. And his exam has many works. So, good luck on it.  ...  2020-10-06\n",

Does not use piazza, barely uses D2L. Extremely lazy when posting information about hw and exams. Does not post announcements at all. Joke of a professor at an academic institution.  ...  2020-10-01\n",
              "10                      Teacher that does not like students despite what he himself thinks. Overall, the class was uncomfortable with an almost hostile feeling to it. He also does not understand modern approaches to software projects. Class also does not have a lot of resources. You will be punished for using internet for help (not code copying). Also no piazza.  ...  2020-09-23\n",
              "11             Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree  ...  2020-05-15\n",
              "12            Dr. Misurda gets a lot of hate, some of which I think is justifiable, but Dr. Misurda is definitely one of the best systems professors in CS. His 352 class is difficult, but you'll be thankful when you take OS (452). Once you've taken one of his exams, you know what to expect. Working hard in his classes will prepare you more than the alternatives.  ...  2020-05-12\n",
              "13               I really dont understand all the negative reviews for Dr. Misurda. His lectures are amazing and he is passionate about the subject material. If you dont wanna learn, dont take his course. If you do wanna learn, hes the professor for you. He goes very deep into the material. Outside of class his email response time is the quickest I've ever seen.  ...  2020-05-11\n",

              "15  Misurda has the style of teaching being, &quot;You're on your own&quot;. His lectures are very dry and hard to convey sometimes. For 5 weeks he did his 'slides' on a piece of paper where students would follow and copy notes. Come exam time, he doesn't have them. The class average for that exam was a 60 and our second midterm exam average was a 58. Dont recco  ...  2020-04-16\n",
              "16                  Not the worst teacher in the world, at least compared to what I've heard about last semesters. But holy cow I don't understand the point of this class, everything he's gone over has already been taught in previous CS classes, so you just sit there while he over explains things that other teachers taught in four minutes that takes him an hour.  ...  2020-02-25\n",

He gives us projects to do and we have not even completed the lecture on what we need to complete the projects.  ...  2020-02-10\n",
              "18  He is funny but you can't deny his holier-than-thou attitude. He used to disregard me in office hours and participation because he genuinely enjoys humiliating a student who volunteers to contribute in class. Also I once asked him to review my bugged code and he scuffed at me &quot;your attempt isn't good enough for a rudimentary problem&quot; So opinionated  ...  2020-02-03\n",
