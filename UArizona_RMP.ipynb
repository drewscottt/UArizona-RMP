Then, I transform the data to filter interesting information about the data, use libraries to infer demographic information about the professors, and aggregate data to create datasets for each department and course at the UofA. Then, I load all of this information into a database. I have example queries for each of the tables loaded into the DB, showing what sorts of questions can be asked about the data.\n",

But holy cow I don't understand the point of this class, everything he's gone over has already been taught in previous CS classes, so you just sit there while he over explains things that other teachers taught in four minutes that takes him an hour.  ...  2020-02-25\n",
              "4   Misurda has the style of teaching being, &quot;You're on your own&quot;. His lectures are very dry and hard to convey sometimes. For 5 weeks he did his 'slides' on a piece of paper where students would follow and copy notes. Come exam time, he doesn't have them. The class average for that exam was a 60 and our second midterm exam average was a 58. Dont recco  ...  2020-04-16\n",

If you dont wanna learn, dont take his course. If you do wanna learn, hes the professor for you. He goes very deep into the material. Outside of class his email response time is the quickest I've ever seen.  ...  2020-05-11\n",
              "7             Dr. Misurda gets a lot of hate, some of which I think is justifiable, but Dr. Misurda is definitely one of the best systems professors in CS. His 352 class is difficult, but you'll be thankful when you take OS (452). Once you've taken one of his exams, you know what to expect. Working hard in his classes will prepare you more than the alternatives.  ...  2020-05-12\n",

No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class.

He also does not understand modern approaches to software projects. Class also does not have a lot of resources. You will be punished for using internet for help (not code copying). Also no piazza.  ...  2020-09-23\n",

He doesn't give a lot of homework so I you don't do well there isn't much of a buffer. He often speaks the whole lecture, so it's hard to follow for 75 minutes. He often gives snarky responses to the students when they ask questions.  ...  2021-02-15\n",
